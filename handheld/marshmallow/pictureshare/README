Implementation notes :

( I ran into issues using the dropbox api v2 released this month/ Nov 2015 , therefore opted for the 1.x version of API)

This is a barebones  implementation that  :
    * allows the user to authenticate to dropbox
    * provides access to camera/ taking pictures
    * uploads picture to dropbox  /photos/

Coding standards
Used longer,  spelt out variables names that are easier to search,  less ambivalent
Avoided the mPrefixOnInstanceVariables to avoid crowding of the namespace around m*

/screenshots/ contains the screenshots of the running app on my system

How to build:

1) Edit PictureShareMainActivity.java ( app/src/main/java/io/wearbook/pictureshare/PictureShareMainActivity.java)
/* please input your API KEY and SECRET below:
    https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create */
 private static final String DROPBOX_APPKEY      = "YOUR API KEY" ;
 private static final String DROPBOX_APPSECRET   = "YOUR APP SECRET" ;

2) Compile via your IDE or via the command line $ gradle clean installDebug

3) Run the App
