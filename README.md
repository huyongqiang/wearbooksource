Since the time that this codebase and book were written, there have been many changes and upgrades to the Android SDK build tools, Android Wear API, Google Fit API, gradle plugins, and Android Studio.  As of October 2015, this code base is  undergoing upgrades to align with current  build tools  version 23 and API version 23 / Android OS code name  ["Marshmallow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Marshmallow). This effort to catchup with the current build tools is  expected to be completed by mid October,  stay tuned.
