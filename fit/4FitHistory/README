This example accesses/ reads Fit history data(cumulative steps). You might  see an empty set of data in case you do not have any Fit History data/ you  have not run the associated FitWHistory ( Fit Write History) App. 

After you have run the FitWHistory App, running the current App should show you Fit History Data.

To illustrate such  before and after results, this example has been  sequentially placed/numbered  prior to the FitWHistory App.

Building and Running
--------------------
1. Setup Google Fit ( Fitness ) API access via the Google Console https://console.developers.google.com.
   The steps for activating  the Google Fit "Fitness"  API and setting up the Android client ID are available
   at :
    https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/
    https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started

2. Ensure that this projects src/main/res/values/version.xml has the  Google Play Services version that
   you are integrating with based on dependency declared in your app/build.gradle dependencies such as
   >> compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.8.0'   ( 789500)
   or later per your build settings.  If for any reason you do not get the version right, you will
   encounter a helpful runtime errori message along the lines :
    ( Expected versionX but found versionY).
    Using  "versionY"  in your src/main/res/values/version.xml should fix this matter.
 
3. Copy  build.gradle.CHANGEME to build.gradle and modify its content to match your keystore specifics

4. Build and install App:
	$ gradle clean installRelease
       
5. Run the App
   The App will display the Fit History data ( cumulative steps) if such data was written to the Fit History by any App including but not limited to  this  book's sample App FitWHistory ( Fit Write History).
